# Combat

## Initial Setup
1. There are two sides. The player, and the enemy.
2. They player has multiple characters on their side, and the enemy like wise.
3. Each of those characters have a set of equipment, which don't change during the battle. All equipment is visible to the player.
4. One side must defeat all characters of the other side, ie. reduce their hp bars to 0.
5. They will do that by taking turns. Player goes first.

## Player Turn
1. At the start of the your (the player's) turn, both sides draw X cards from their decks. 
2. You can use those cards to activate equipment on any characters.
3. You can use cards and activiate equipment in any order.
3. Once you've done everything you want, you can end your turn.

## Enemy Turn
1. The enemy doesn't draw at the start of their turn, since they've already done that at the start of the player turn.
2. The enemy also uses cards to activate their equipment on their characters.
3. The enemy will typically follow a predictable pattern, which the player can use to their advantage.
4. Once the enemy is finished, their turn ends and the player's turn begins again.

## Cards and Equipment
1. There are 5 types of cards: Strength cards, Dexterity cards, Constitution cards, Intelligence cards, and Wisdom cards.
2. In order to use a character's equipment and activate its affect, you must play cards according to the equipment's activation cost. An activation cost typically requires a specific number of a certain type of card. For example: 2 STR (meaning 2 strength cards).
3. Many equipment also have alternate costs, which offer a different way to pay the activation. Typically these require more cards, but they can be of any type. For example: 2 STR or 3 ANY (meaning either 2 strength cards, or 3 of any type cards).
4. Once you pay the equipment cost, the cards you used are discarded. They will be re-shuffled into yoru deck when your deck runs out.
5. In general, equipment can only be activated once per turn. 
6. But you can activate any equipment across all your characters, as long as you can pay their costs. 

## Equipment Examples
1. Phaseblade: 1 STR or 2 ANY => Deal 8 damage to an enemy.
2. Plasma Rifle: 1 DEX or 3 ANY => Deal 5 damage to all enemies.
3. Reflector: 1 CON or 2 ANY => Gain 10 block.
4. Neural Implant: 1 INT => Draw 2 cards. Those cards may be only used to activate this character's equipment.
5. Scanner: 2 WIS => Reveal 2 of the enemy's hidden cards.

## Character Skills
1. In addition to equipment, characters also have innate skills they always have access to. Some skills need to be activated, others are "passive" and modify existing effects.
